# Evolutionary Process

## Epoch-Based Evolution
The system operates in discrete evolutionary epochs:

1. Branch models undergo supervised and reinforcement learning
2. Performance metrics are gathered and analyzed
3. Successful traits are identified and preserved
4. New variants are generated through controlled mutation
5. Underperforming models are pruned
6. Process repeats with improved population
