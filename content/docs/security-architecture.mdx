# Security Architecture

Arbor's security architecture is built on a foundation of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and modern cryptographic principles to ensure the highest level of protection for AI workloads and sensitive data.

## Core Security Components

### Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- Hardware-isolated secure enclaves
- Runtime memory encryption
- Remote attestation capabilities
- Protected execution guarantees

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure data ingestion
- Protected model storage
- Encrypted inference results

### Access Control
- Fine-grained permissions
- Identity-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging and monitoring

## Security Flow

1. **Secure Initialization**
   - TEE environment validation
   - Remote attestation verification
   - Cryptographic key establishment

2. **Data Processing**
   - Encrypted data ingestion
   - Secure model loading
   - Protected inference execution
   - Encrypted result delivery

3. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Real-time security checks
   - Audit trail generation
   - Anomaly detection
   - Compliance validation

## Technical Implementation

### TEE Integration
Arbor leverages Intel SGX technology to provide:
- Memory encryption and isolation
- Hardware-based attestation
- Secure key management
- Protected execution spaces

### Cryptographic Infrastructure
- AES-256 for data encryption
- RSA-4096 for key exchange
- SHA-256 for integrity checks
- TLS 1.3 for secure communication

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Arbor:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Verify TEE configuration
   - Enable all security features
   - Follow least privilege principle
   - Regular security updates

2. **Data Handling**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Implement secure channels
   - Validate data integrity
   - Proper key management

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Regular security audits
   - Monitor system logs
   - Update security policies
   - Incident response planning

## Compliance and Standards

Arbor's security architecture adheres to:
- Industry security standards
- Data protection regulations
- Privacy requirements
- Compliance frameworks

## Getting Started with Secure Deployment

To implement a secure Arbor deployment:

1. Review security documentation
2. Configure TEE environment
3. Implement access controls
4. Enable monitoring systems
5. Test security measures
