# About Arbor

Arbor is a cutting-edge autonomous agent platform that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enable secure, verifiable, and privacy-preserving AI agents. Built for developers and enterprises, Arbor provides the infrastructure needed to deploy autonomous agents that can handle sensitive data and execute critical tasks while maintaining the highest standards of security and trust.

## Core Features

### Secure Execution Environment
- Runs within Intel SGX enclaves, providing hardware-level isolation
- Cryptographic attestation ensures code integrity
- Protected memory regions prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data

### Privacy-First Architecture 
- End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest
- Zero-knowledge proofs validate computation without revealing data
- Fine-grained access controls and audit logging

### Advanced AI Capabilities
- Seamless integration with popular LLM models
- Built-in support for autonomous reasoning and decision making
- Extensible plugin system for custom AI capabilities

### Developer-Centric Design
- Clean APIs and comprehensive SDK
- Flexible deployment options (cloud, on-prem, hybrid)
- Rich documentation and example implementations

## How It Works

Arbor creates a secure sandbox for AI agents using Intel SGX technology. When you deploy an agent, it runs within an encrypted enclave that protects both the code and data from tampering. The platform handles all the complexity of:

1. Secure key management and attestation
2. Protected memory management
3. Encrypted communication channels
4. Resource allocation and scaling

This allows developers to focus on building intelligent agents while Arbor handles the security and infrastructure concerns.
