# Introduction to Seed AI

Seed AI represents a groundbreaking advancement in artificial intelligence - a self-evolving, self-improving system that continuously generates and optimizes specialized AI models through iterative evolution.

## What is Seed AI?

At its core, Seed AI is a framework that enables:
- Autonomous evolution of AI models
- Self-optimization through recursive improvement
- Multi-agent collaboration and competition
- Distributed intelligence across specialized domains

## Key Features

### Self-Evolution
The system continuously evolves and improves its own architecture, learning from both successes and failures to create increasingly sophisticated AI models.

### Distributed Intelligence
Rather than a monolithic system, Seed AI operates as a distributed network of specialized agents, each contributing to the collective intelligence of the system.

### Secure Architecture
Built with security at its core, Seed AI implements advanced isolation and verification mechanisms to ensure safe and controlled evolution.
