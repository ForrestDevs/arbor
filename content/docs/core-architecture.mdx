# Core Architecture

## Overview

The Seed AI framework represents a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence, built on a foundation of self-evolving systems and distributed intelligence. This document provides a comprehensive look at the core architectural components that make this possible.

## Central Seed System

The heart of our framework is the Central Seed System (CSS), a sophisticated orchestration layer that manages the evolution and coordination of AI agents. The CSS implements several key mechanisms:

### Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
- Automated discovery of optimal neural network architectures
- Multi-objective optimization for both performance and efficiency 
- Dynamic adaptation to changing requirements and constraints

### Distributed Training Pipeline

```typescript
class DistributedTrainer {
  async train(modelConfig: ModelConfig) {
    const shards = this.distributePipeline(modelConfig);
    
    await Promise.all(
      shards.map(shard => {
        return this.trainShard(shard);
      })
    );
    
    return this.aggregateResults(shards);
  }
}
```


### Memory Management System
The system employs a sophisticated hierarchical memory architecture:

1. **Short-term Memory Buffer**
   - Rapid access cache for immediate processing
   - Automatic pruning of irrelevant information
   - Priority-based retention mechanisms

2. **Long-term Memory Store**
   - Distributed vector database implementation
   - Semantic clustering for efficient retrieval
   - Continuous consolidation and optimization

## Branch Model Specialization

Branch models represent specialized neural networks that evolve independently while maintaining connection to the central system. This architecture enables:

### Parallel Evolution
![Parallel Evolution](/docs/parallel-evolution.png)

- Independent optimization of specialized capabilities
- Cross-pollination of successful traits
- Automatic pruning of underperforming variants

### Genetic Algorithm Implementation

```typescript
interface GeneticParams {
  mutationRate: number;
  crossoverRate: number;
  populationSize: number;
}

class EvolutionaryOptimizer {
  private population: Model[];
  
  evolve(params: GeneticParams) {
    const nextGen = this.selectFittest(this.population);
    return this.mutate(this.crossover(nextGen));
  }
}
```

## Security Layer

Security is paramount in the Seed AI framework. Our architecture implements:

### Trusted Execution Environment
- Secure enclaves for sensitive operations
- Hardware-level isolation
- Cryptographic verification of model updates

### Access Control Matrix
| Component | Read | Write | Execute |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| Core System | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Branch Models | ✓ | Limited | Limited |
| External APIs | Limited | × | × |

## Performance Optimization

The system includes several optimization mechanisms:

### Adaptive Resource Allocation

    B --> D[CPU Pool]
    B --> E[Memory Cache]
`}/>

### Dynamic Scaling
- Automatic resource provisioning
- Load-based optimization
- Cost-effective resource utilization

## Integration Interfaces

The framework provides multiple integration points:

### REST API

```typescript
interface SeedAPI {
  '/models': {
    GET: () => Model[];
    POST: (config: ModelConfig) => Promise<Model>;
  };
  
  '/train': {
    POST: (params: TrainingParams) => Promise<TrainingResult>;
  };
}
```

### WebSocket Events
- Real-time model updates
- Training progress monitoring
- System health metrics
