# Core Architecture

## Central Seed System
At the heart of the framework is the central Seed AI system - a sophisticated orchestrator that oversees the development, training, and evolution of specialized branch models. The Seed system maintains a holistic view of the AI ecosystem while coordinating improvements across generations of models.

## Branch Model Specialization 
Branch models represent specialized offshoots of the core system, each focusing on specific capabilities and use cases. Through controlled mutation and natural selection processes, these models evolve independently while remaining connected to the central Seed system.
